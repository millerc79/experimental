# Mac Setup Guide - Incoming Scans Automation

This guide helps you set up automated PDF processing for your iCloud "Incoming Scans" folder on your Mac.

## Your Setup

**Watched Folder**: `/Users/chadmiller/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Incoming Scans`

This folder will be monitored for new PDFs, which will be:
- Read for content (receipts, invoices, statements, etc.)
- Renamed with dates automatically extracted from the PDF
- Moved to organized subfolders

## Quick Start (On Your Mac)

### 1. First, clone this repository to your Mac

```bash
cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you want to keep it
git clone https://github.com/millerc79/Experimental.git
cd Experimental
```

### 2. Install PyPDF2

```bash
pip3 install PyPDF2
```

Or use the requirements file:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Test with Dry Run (Safe!)

This shows what would happen WITHOUT actually moving files:

```bash
./run_incoming_scans.sh dry-run
```

This will:
- Check your Incoming Scans folder for PDFs
- Show what rules would match
- Show what the files would be renamed to
- Show where they would be moved
- **But NOT actually move anything**

### 4. Process Once

If the dry run looks good, process the current files:

```bash
./run_incoming_scans.sh once
```

### 5. Start Watching (Continuous Monitoring)

To continuously monitor for new PDFs:

```bash
./run_incoming_scans.sh watch
```

This will:
- Check every 30 seconds for new PDFs
- Automatically process them based on your rules
- Keep running until you press Ctrl+C

## Customizing Rules

Edit `pdf_rules.json` to customize what happens to your PDFs.

**Default rules included:**
- App Store receipts → `Receipts/` folder
- Bank statements → `Banking/Statements/` folder
- Invoices → `Invoices/` folder
- Tax documents → `Taxes/` folder
- Utility bills → `Bills/Utilities/` folder

### Example: Add a Rule for Medical Bills

Edit `pdf_rules.json` and add:

```json
{
  "name": "Medical Bills",
  "description": "Organizes medical and insurance bills",
  "conditions": {
    "extension": "pdf",
    "content_contains": ["patient", "medical"]
  },
  "actions": {
    "rename_pattern": "Medical_{date}_{year}{ext}",
    "move_to": "Medical/Bills"
  }
}
```

Then test:
```bash
./run_incoming_scans.sh dry-run
```

## Running Automatically on Startup

To have this run automatically when you log into your Mac:

### Option 1: Create a LaunchAgent (Recommended)

1. Create a plist file:

```bash
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.chadmiller.pdfautomation.plist
```

2. Paste this content (update the path to where you cloned the repo):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.chadmiller.pdfautomation</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/chadmiller/Documents/Experimental/run_incoming_scans.sh</string>
        <string>watch</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/chadmiller/pdf_automation.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/chadmiller/pdf_automation_error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

3. Load it:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.chadmiller.pdfautomation.plist
```

4. To stop it:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.chadmiller.pdfautomation.plist
```

### Option 2: Add to Login Items

1. Open System Settings → General → Login Items
2. Click the "+" button
3. Navigate to and select `run_incoming_scans.sh`
4. Make sure it's set to run at login

**Note**: This method shows the terminal window. Use LaunchAgent for background operation.

## Monitoring and Logs

### Check if it's running:

```bash
ps aux | grep pdf_automation
```

### View logs (if using LaunchAgent):

```bash
tail -f ~/pdf_automation.log
```

### Manual check of what's being processed:

```bash
./run_incoming_scans.sh dry-run
```

## Folder Structure

After processing, your Incoming Scans folder will have organized subfolders:

```
/Users/chadmiller/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Incoming Scans/
├── Receipts/
│   ├── App Store_2025-01-15_2025.pdf
│   └── App Store_2025-01-20_2025.pdf
├── Banking/
│   └── Statements/
│       └── Bank_Statement_2025-01-01.pdf
├── Invoices/
│   └── Invoice_2025-01-10_2025.pdf
└── Bills/
    └── Utilities/
        └── Utility_Bill_2025-01-05.pdf
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Incoming Scans folder not found"

Check that:
1. iCloud Drive is enabled and syncing
2. The folder exists in iCloud Drive
3. The path is correct (check in Finder: Go → Go to Folder → paste the path)

### "PyPDF2 not installed"

Run:
```bash
pip3 install PyPDF2
```

If `pip3` isn't found:
```bash
python3 -m pip install PyPDF2
```

### PDFs aren't being processed

1. Check that they contain searchable text (not scanned images)
2. Run dry-run to see what's detected
3. Check the rules in `pdf_rules.json`
4. Look at the logs

### Want to stop automatic processing

```bash
# If using LaunchAgent:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.chadmiller.pdfautomation.plist

# If running manually, just press Ctrl+C
```

## Testing the Setup

Put a test PDF in your Incoming Scans folder and run:

```bash
./run_incoming_scans.sh dry-run
```

You should see output showing:
- PDF was found
- What keywords were matched
- What the new name would be
- Where it would be moved

## Command Reference

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `./run_incoming_scans.sh dry-run` | Preview changes (safe) |
| `./run_incoming_scans.sh once` | Process current PDFs |
| `./run_incoming_scans.sh watch` | Monitor continuously |
| `./run_incoming_scans.sh` | Same as `watch` (default) |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Clone repo to your Mac
2. ✅ Install PyPDF2
3. ✅ Run dry-run to test
4. ✅ Customize rules in `pdf_rules.json`
5. ✅ Set up LaunchAgent for automatic startup
6. ✅ Monitor the logs to ensure it's working

---

**Pro Tip**: Start with dry-run mode and test with a few PDFs before setting up automatic processing. Once you're confident it works as expected, set up the LaunchAgent for hands-free operation!
