# File Organizer - Claude Guidelines

This project inherits all standards from [../../claude.md](../../claude.md).
<!-- If cloned without parent folder, see Core Standards below -->

## Project Overview

Simple Python utility for organizing files into categorized folders based on file type/extension.

## Project-Specific Notes

This tool moves files, which is a **high-risk operation**. Always:
- Use dry-run mode first to preview changes
- Get explicit confirmation before executing
- Verify operations completed successfully
