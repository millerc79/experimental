# Experimental - Learning & Automation Projects

Welcome! This is my workspace for learning programming and building automation tools. When projects mature, they graduate to their own repositories.

## 🚀 Projects

### 📄 [PDF Automation Tool](https://github.com/millerc79/pdf-automation-tool)

Smart PDF organizer - a local alternative to Hazel with intelligent year detection.

**Features:**
- Automatically extracts years from PDF content (no yearly rule updates needed!)
- Intelligent date extraction and file renaming
- Year-based folder organization
- 100% local processing (no cloud services)
- Comprehensive security analysis

**Tech:** Python, PyPDF2

### 📁 [File Organizer](https://github.com/millerc79/file-organizer)

Simple Python utility for automatically organizing files into categorized folders by type.

**Features:**
- Automatically sorts files by extension (Images, Documents, Videos, Music, etc.)
- Safe file operations with duplicate detection
- Easy to customize categories
- No external dependencies

**Tech:** Python (stdlib only)

## 📚 About This Repository

This repo serves as:
- **Learning workspace** - Experimenting with code and trying new ideas
- **Project incubator** - Prototyping before projects get their own repos
- **Portfolio hub** - Links to completed projects
- **AI-assisted development** - Experimenting with AI coding assistants as learning tools

### Philosophy

- **Learn by doing** - Build real tools that solve actual problems
- **Start simple** - Begin with basics, add complexity gradually
- **Ship it** - Move projects to their own repos when they're ready
- **Privacy first** - Never commit personal info or secrets (see [CLAUDE.MD](CLAUDE.MD))
- **Transparent development** - Many projects here involve AI-assisted coding as part of the learning process

### Development Approach

I'm experimenting with AI coding assistants (like Claude) as tools for learning programming. This means:
- Code in this repo may be written with AI assistance
- AI helps explain concepts, debug issues, and suggest implementations
- I'm learning through this collaborative process
- The goal is understanding, not just working code

This is a learning journey, and AI assistance is one of the tools I'm using to accelerate that learning.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Building foundational programming skills
- Understanding automation and file operations
- Writing secure, well-documented code
- Learning best practices for git and open source

## 📖 Code Quality Standards

This repository follows strict code quality and privacy guidelines documented in [CLAUDE.MD](CLAUDE.MD):

- **Security & Safety** - No vulnerabilities, safe file operations
- **Data Loss Prevention** - Dry-run modes, backups recommended
- **Repository Privacy** - Never commit personal info or secrets
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive exception handling
- **Documentation** - Clear explanations and examples

These standards apply to all projects developed here and carry over to their own repos.

## 🛠️ Repository Contents

This repo currently contains:

- **Export branches** - Prepared branches for setting up separate project repos
  - `claude/export-pdf-tool-SJXK8` - PDF automation tool
  - `claude/export-file-organizer-SJXK8` - File organizer
- **Development branches** - Active work on projects before they graduate
- **CLAUDE.MD** - Universal code quality standards and privacy guidelines

## 💡 Future Ideas

Potential projects to explore:
- More automation tools
- Learning exercises and tutorials
- Small utilities and scripts
- Whatever seems interesting!

## 📝 Note

This is a learning environment. Code doesn't need to be perfect - it's about experimentation and growth. When a project is ready for others to use, it gets its own repository with proper documentation.

**Philosophy:** Learn by doing. Build real tools. Ship them. Keep learning.
