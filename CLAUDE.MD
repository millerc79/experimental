# Experimental - Practice & Testing Space

This project inherits all standards from [../claude.md](../claude.md).
<!-- If cloned without parent folder, see Core Standards below -->

## Project-Specific Notes

This folder is for experimentation, testing ideas, and trying new approaches. Code here may be rough or incomplete—that's expected.

### Guidelines
- **Low stakes**: This is a safe space to try things that might not work
- **Quick iterations**: Favor fast experiments over polished code
- **Learn from failures**: Failed experiments are still valuable

### Subprojects
- **[file-organizer/](file-organizer/)** - File organization utility
- **[my-test-project/](my-test-project/)** - Testing space
